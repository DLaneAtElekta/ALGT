-- Scenario: 01_clinical_workflow
--
-- A realistic end-to-end clinical workflow that exercises every entity:
--   T1: register two patients
--   T2: create a treatment plan for patient 1
--   T3: approve the plan
--   T4: schedule three treatment appointments + one consult
--   T5: check in patient 1 for first appointment
--   T6: record session 1 (with offsets, ISqrt magnitude per treatment-offset/)
--   T7: complete the first appointment
--   T8: cancel the third appointment (no-show recovery)
--   T9: update patient 2 demographics
--
-- When run against a database with the tm_pub_all publication active, this
-- generates the WAL events captured in db/traces/01_clinical_workflow.wal.jsonl
-- (the offline fixture for the Prolog port).
